      <h1>Year in Review - 2023</h1>
      <p>Last year, I posted my first &ldquo;Year in Review&rdquo; and it was a great way for me to reflect and document some of my new experiences and projects I completed.</p>
<p>It was a busy year with my wife and I searching for a house, and I was happy to still make time learn new things. I had fun learning how to optimize apps and sites I created and customize templates &amp; themes others built. I also had my first ever pull request approved for an open source project! Here&rsquo;s some of the highlights from my last year.</p>
<h2 id="swimming-and-tracking">Swimming and Tracking</h2>
<p>I started lap swimming in November of 2022 right after the Thanksgiving holiday. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed swimming since I took lessons as a kid at the YMCA, and getting back in the pool has been a fun journey. Being a &ldquo;data person&rdquo;, I couldn&rsquo;t resist tracking data from my swims, and started with a simple spreadsheet on Google Sheets.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2023-year-in-review/google-sheets-swimming.png" alt="Google Sheets swim tracking"></p>
<p>My wife gifted me an Apple Watch for my birthday last February which helped me track swimming workouts in more detail. I have loved having the watch generally but especially for swimming. It has eased the cognitive load of my workouts since I don&rsquo;t have to mentally keep track of my laps and time.</p>
<p>With this improved data, I wanted to build a more advanced way to track my metrics. I started looking for a way to build something that would report my results and allow me to enter data on the same page. Around the same time, Metabase introduced a new feature called Actions which allow a user to enter data from a dashboard via a button. It was the perfect fit for me since I already had a Metabase server up and running. I got to work transferring my data from Google Sheets to my existing MySQL database. Luckily, I had only recorded a dozen or so swims at that point.</p>
<p>Since setting up my Metabase dashboard, entering workouts is easy and they are stored in the database for use in future projects. I wrote a post about <a href="https://johnthompson.io/posts/metabase-actions/">Metabase Actions</a> and a <a href="https://johnthompson.io/posts/metabase-actions-tutorial/">tutorial on how I use them in my swimming dashboard</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>In 2023, I swam 73 times for just over 58 miles! Given that I missed swimming for a couple months recovering from COVID early in the year, I&rsquo;m pretty proud of these stats!</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2023-year-in-review/2023-swim-results.png" alt="2023 Swim Results"></p>
<p>My goal for 2024 is to swim 100 miles, and of course I&rsquo;m tracking my progress with data!</p>

<h2 id="personal-website---johnthompsonio">Personal Website - johnthompson.io</h2>
<p>I launched my <a href="https://johnthompson.io/">personal website</a> in December of 2022, and have spent time in 2023 making updates, adding content, and customizing the styles and navigation.</p>
<p>My goal with the site was to serve as a hub for my interests, accomplishments, and background in a single place rather than distributed across many social media platforms and sites. I wanted something where my content was owned and presented by me, and not subject to the control of someone else. Plus, building is fun, and I wanted to build it myself.</p>
<p>I chose <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> as the framework for the site. It was technical enough to be a challenge while not requiring me to spend a year learning JavaScript. With <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">lots of great themes</a> to choose from, I ended up going with the <a href="https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole">Anatole theme</a>. It&rsquo;s nice and minimal while still being actively maintained, and has a portfolio section included which I wanted.</p>
<p>Once I got the site up and running, I took time to customize the theme to fit what I wanted the site to look like. I added some style changes learning a bit of CSS &amp; SCSS along the way, which was new for me. More importantly than learning the code, I also learned how SCSS interacts with variables, gets incorporated into the Hugo templates, and flows into the final HTML that builds the site.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2023-year-in-review/scss.png" alt="SCSS files"></p>
<p>I made another change to split my Portfolio page into a separate pages for Projects and Speaking, and added a formatted Resume section as well. All of these pages pull from YAML files that contain the configuration and data to fill in the content. Figuring out the way the data in these files made it to the HTML document was a rewarding experience in detective work.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2023-year-in-review/yaml.png" alt="Yaml files"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with the website today, and there&rsquo;s more I still want to with it. Adding sections to cover some of my non-tech hobbies like bird watching, music, and reading are next up, and I&rsquo;d like to make some video content as well.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="finnstructions---mkdocs--markdown">Finnstructions - MkDocs &amp; Markdown</h2>
<p>I caught the <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> bug in 2022, and continued learning more in 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a> came on my radar again at my day job, and I wanted hands-on experience to prepare for some documentation I was looking to write in the near future. Building on my prior static site generation experience with Hugo, MkDocs was fairly straight forward to get up and running. I needed a topic to write about to use as content my test case, so I decided to write some (tongue in cheek) documentation around caring for my dog, Finn.</p>
<p>My experience with MkDocs was really positive, and I&rsquo;ll probably use it for documentation cases when one comes up. The integrated search, easy to set up menus, and simple navigation are great features. Writing the content in Markdown is excellent, I&rsquo;ve found Markdown to be a great compliment to my other data skills. I&rsquo;ve used it everywhere from GitHub Issues, SharePoint, and I even write my daily notes in Markdown. If you want to get started with Markdown, my advice is to get a good linter extension for your IDE to help you learn the proper syntax.</p>
<p>In the end, I the documentation was good enough to publish, and Finn-structions was born! Now when Finn needs to spend a weekend with a family member or friend, all his care instructions are available online for them to reference.</p>
<p>This was my favorite project of the year!</p>

<h2 id="listening-reading-and-speaking">Listening, Reading, and Speaking</h2>
<p>Over the last year, I listened to over 14,000 minutes of podcasts, read over 4 million words, and spoke at 2 conferences!</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a podcast fan ever since I started listening to them during my frequent 10-hour drives between Wichita, KS to my hometown of Minneapolis. My favorite shows have changed over the years with some staples like <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcasts/">Freakonomics Radio</a>, the <a href="https://analyticshour.io/">Analytics Power Hour</a>, and the <a href="https://www.americanpublicmedia.org/podcast">APM family of news &amp; economics shows</a> remaining constant and others rotating in and out.</p>
<p>This year, my favorite new (to me) podcast has been <a href="https://hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes with Scott Hanselman</a>. I caught on to this one a bit late, which is great since there are over 900 episodes in the backlog to listen to! Scott covers tech topics and I appreciate his diverse guest lineup and approach to exploring data topics from a position of empathy and kindness.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>In 2022, I rediscovered my love of fiction which carried over in 2023. I found it restorative to have an analog hobby when so much of my day is spent with a keyboard and screen. It helps that we have a lovely balcony deck at home to read on in the summer months!</p>
<p>Growing up, I read several fantasy series like Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and the Belgariad. After watching the Amazon adaptation of The Wheel of Time, I decided to read the books knowing they are one of the most popular and well regarded fantasy series of all time. Knowing this would also give me nerd street cred, I got started. 14 months later I finished the series in March of 2023.</p>
<p>I loved the series and couldn&rsquo;t put it down. I found the world engaging, the characters fascinating, and the magic system fun and unique. After finishing, I wished I could use the <a href="https://meninblack.fandom.com/wiki/Neuralyzer">Neuralyzer from Men in Black</a> to erase my memory so I could experience the story for the first time again.</p>

<p>After finishing The Wheel of Time, I dove in to some other fantasy series. I focused on the worlds of author Brandon Sanderson, who helped finish The Wheel of Time after the original author, Robert Jordan, passed away. A prolific author, I worked through the Sanderson catalog finishing the Mistborn series, The Stormlight Archive series, and almost all his writing from the Cosmere universe. This added another 13 books to my list, bringing my total to 17 for the year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to keep reading in 2024, and am planning to pivot to some non-fiction to work through my stack of unread books before the next Stormlight Archive book is released in December.</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I was speaking once or twice per year. When the pandemic hit and conferences &amp; user groups dried up, so did many of these opportunities. I was happy to get back in front of people this year sharing my experiences and hearing their presentations too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning to attend local meetups and user groups more regularly in 2024, and am looking forward to more opportunities to present!</p>
