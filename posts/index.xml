        <description>For 35 of my 37 years on this planet, I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in the state of Minnesota. Notorious for its cold winters, I&amp;rsquo;ve grown a certain affinity for the discomfort January and February bring. With a record low of -32°F (-35.6°C) in my lifetime1, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of cold weather experience.
I like to get outside and feel the bite of the cold and see my breath hanging in the air, for me it&amp;rsquo;s an invigorating experience!</description>

        <description>I made a decision last January to step outside my comfort zone of proprietary low-code tools and start exploring open source projects and tools.
I wanted to challenge myself to learn the skills I would need to be self-sufficient owning, using, and deploying analytic tools that fit the projects I wanted to complete. This meant using inexpensive or free frameworks. In order to build the skills I would need, and I planned out experiences that would allow me to learn through hands-on and realistic projects.</description>
