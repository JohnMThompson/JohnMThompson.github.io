        <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a decision last January to step outside my comfort zone of proprietary low-code tools and start exploring open source projects and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to challenge myself to learn the skills I would need to be self-sufficient owning, using, and deploying analytic tools that fit the projects I wanted to complete. This meant using inexpensive or free frameworks. In order to build the skills I would need, and I planned out experiences that would allow me to learn through hands-on and realistic projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
