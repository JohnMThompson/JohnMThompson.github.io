        <description>&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have been house hunting for several months, and the mortgage rate market in the United States has been up and down. I&amp;rsquo;ve find myself looking at rates from local lenders daily, navigating to their websites and writing the rates down or mentally taking note of where they are at. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to see trends and understand if rates are rising or falling over time since, although there are daily fluctuations, meaningful changes take place over weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
