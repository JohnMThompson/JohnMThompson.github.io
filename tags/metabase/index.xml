        <description>My wife and I have been house hunting for several months, and the mortgage rate market in the United States has been up and down. I&amp;rsquo;ve find myself looking at rates from local lenders daily, navigating to their websites and writing the rates down or mentally taking note of where they are at. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to see trends and understand if rates are rising or falling over time since, although there are daily fluctuations, meaningful changes take place over weeks or months.</description>

        <description>Overview I started lap swimming this year and once I discovered Metabase Actions I thought it was the perfect way to track my workouts!
This tutorial will show how to build an app to track swimming workouts using Metabase&amp;rsquo;s new Actions feature. For some general background on Actions, check out my corresponding post to this tutorial.
Assumptions &amp;amp; Prerequisites Here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to build a dashboard Actions:

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Metabase for personal projects for the last year or so and love their simple and friendly user experience. As a platform it sets up quickly, you can get up and running in about 10 minutes.
In Metabase version 0.46, a new feature was released called Actions which enable database write back from Metabase to your database. In my experience this feature is unusual in a BI tool, where most vendors prefer to be the endpoint to an analysis workflow.</description>

        <description>I made a decision last January to step outside my comfort zone of proprietary low-code tools and start exploring open source projects and tools.
I wanted to challenge myself to learn the skills I would need to be self-sufficient owning, using, and deploying analytic tools that fit the projects I wanted to complete. This meant using inexpensive or free frameworks. In order to build the skills I would need, and I planned out experiences that would allow me to learn through hands-on and realistic projects.</description>
